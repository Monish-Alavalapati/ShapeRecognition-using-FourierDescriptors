# Shape Recognition using Fourier Descriptors

## Overview

This MATLAB project focuses on shape recognition using Fourier descriptors. Fourier descriptors are mathematical representations of the shapes of objects, which can be used for shape analysis and recognition. In this project, we leverage the power of Fourier descriptors to recognize and classify different shapes based on their unique frequency domain signatures.

## Features

- **Shape Representation:** Utilizes Fourier descriptors to represent shapes in the frequency domain.
- **Shape Recognition:** Implements a recognition algorithm to identify and classify shapes based on their Fourier descriptors.
- **MATLAB Implementation:** The entire project is developed using MATLAB, making it easy to understand and modify.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure that you have MATLAB installed on your machine. The project has been tested on MATLAB version R2023b, and it is recommended to use a similar or later version.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ShapeRecognition-using-FourierDescriptors.git
    ```

2. **Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.**

3. **Run the main script:**

    ```matlab
    run main_script.m
    ```

4. **Follow the on-screen instructions to input the shape data and observe the recognition results.**

## Usage

Modify the input data or incorporate your own dataset for shape recognition by editing the necessary files in the data . Customize the recognition algorithm or extend the functionality by modifying the source code in the source code .
